My Hope Box Project üáµüá∏

This is a small project I made myself: a donation box simulator for the kids of Palestine. It‚Äôs nothing fancy, but it means a lot to me.


Why I did this ?: 

Honestly, I just felt like I had to do something.

I‚Äôm 14, from Tunisia, and seeing what‚Äôs happening in Gaza every day just breaks my heart. This all hit me even harder after I earned a certificate from UNICEF. It wasn't just a course; it made me think constantly about children's rights and how easily they can be lost.

Then, I saw the ‚ÄúSamoud Convoy‚Äù leaving from my own country. I couldn‚Äôt go, and I felt completely powerless. I use my TikTok to talk about the Qur'an and sometimes Palestine, but I wanted to do more than just post.

So I asked myself: what can I *actually* do?
Well‚Ä¶ I love designing things and I'm interested in electronics. This project is my answer.


How it works ?? :

It‚Äôs super simple, I designed and built the circuit on Wokwi:

*   You press a button (like giving a donation).
*   A buzzer makes a sound (so the action is heard).
*   A little LED lights up (a small light of hope).

That‚Äôs it. Not complicated. But for me, it shows that even the smallest action can still make a noise and shine a light.


Tools I used

*   Concept & Circuit Design: My own idea.
*   Platform: Wokwi Electronics Simulator.
*   Components: Arduino, a button, an LED, and a buzzer.


What I learned from this ? :

I guess I learned you don‚Äôt have to wait for someone to tell you what to do. You can just use what you have, right now, to stand for what you believe in. It felt a lot better to build this than to do nothing.


This is my tiny message of hope. From me in Tunisia, to them.
