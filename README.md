My Hope Box Project üáµüá∏‚ù§Ô∏è :

This is a small project I designed on my computer. It's not a real box, just an idea for the kids in Palestine. But it's important to me.


The story behind this :

Honestly, I just felt useless (The worst consciousness that someone can feel)

I'm 14, from Tunisia. The news from Gaza is hard to watch. I also did a UNICEF course and it got me thinking a lot about kids' rights. Then the "Samoud Convoy" left from my country. I couldn't go and felt totally stuck.
I'm a problem-solver, it's why I'm good at math (I even won first place in my state's olympiad against older students). My brain always wants to find a solution. But this time, I had no idea what to do.
I told my mom I felt powerless. She's the one who said "you don't have to be there to help. You can do something from right here." That idea stuck in my head.
So, I thought I'd build a real donation box. But the parts cost money I didn't have. Another dead end. I almost gave up, but I talked to my tech teacher. She's the one who told me about a free website, Wokwi. A place where I could build my circuit online. She basically saved the project.
So yeah, between my mom's words and my teacher's advice, this project happened. It's my way of being in the convoy, but online.


How it works :

On Wokwi, I designed a simple circuit:
* You press a button.
* A buzzer makes a noise (So the action is heard).
* An LED lights up (A small light of hope).
* When the goal of 30 donations is reached, the box celebrates with a special light and sound show!

Simple. But it's always the idea that counts.



What I used :

* The Idea: My own.
* The Push: My mom (My biggest SUPPORTER).
* The Tool: Wokwi (Thanks to my teacher!).
* The Design: I designed the circuit myself.


What I learned :

I guess I learned that you don't have to give up. Can't go? Do something from home. Can't buy parts? Find a free tool. It's not just about being smart, it's about finding a way. And listening to people who want to help you.

It felt good to build something instead of just watching.


This is my small message of hope from Tunisia.
